## Background   
This project is mainly to obtain various information of Bilibili with web scraping method, including user information, 
video download, bullet comment download, etc. Although the size of this project will depend on my own needs, I will 
finish as many functions as possible.Those features will not be present as a web project or GUI project, but a callable
library, for it is very convenient for me to build many applications.Of course, I feel that this project is more like a 
practice of Python for myself for I've learned a lot, but rarely have the opportunity to code.I have forgotten lots of 
skills and tricks.By the way, I can learn and consolidate those knowledge(Thanks to this outbreak, I have enough time to
write project).Finally, this project is only for learning and communication, please do not use it for any commercial purpose.      

## Finished
* all the code is completed under Windows and has not been tested under Linux, but there should be no problems.   
* video download(Blibili replaces av with bv since February 23, I modified my code so it still can work)

## Install   
First of all, make sure you have installed ffmpeg and remember to add the path to the PATH environment variable.If you 
don't have it, then go to the [here](http://ffmpeg.org/) to download.After that you need to enter the following command 
to install the necessary dependencies.
```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage   
I haven't write a demo for each feature, but it will be added later.If you want to know each function, you can see 
[docs](docs), each function is described in detail in this document.
